# XIARA MOON - FANVUE COMPLETE SETUP GUIDE

## PROFILE BIO (Main Page - What Everyone Sees First)

**Character Limit:** 500-1000 characters (check Fanvue's limit)

**Bio Version (Layer 1 Lead - Broad Appeal):**

```
Welcome to my world. 🌙

I'm Xiara Moon—Japanese elegance meets Brazilian fire, wrapped in something you won't find anywhere else.

This isn't just content. It's an *experience*.

Here, I create intimate audio journeys, hyper-realistic visual art, and moments designed to make you feel something real.

No filters. No performance. Just raw intimacy, sacred sensuality, and experiences that linger long after you've left.

⭐ What you'll find here:
— Hyper-realistic photo galleries (magazine-quality artistry)
— Guided audio experiences (15-30 min intimate journeys)
— Exclusive content you won't see anywhere else
— A space that actually respects your intelligence

I don't do "accessible." I don't do cheap.
I curate my world very carefully.

If you're still here, you already know you want in.

Choose your tier. Enter my world.

**Alternative Bio (Layer 0 Lead - For Testing):**

```
You're still here? 🎀

Good.

I'm Xiara Moon, and if you've made it this far, you already know what this is.

I don't explain myself. I don't beg for attention. I just exist.
And somehow, that's enough to keep you coming back.

Here's what you get:
— Hyper-realistic galleries (the kind of images you save and revisit)
— Audio experiences that will ruin you for anyone else
— Access to me. Which is more than most people get.

I don't do "relatable." I don't do desperate.
Quality costs. Exclusivity matters. I'm worth it.

Pick your tier. Prove you're serious.

This tier is for people who don't just want access—they want *depth*.

What you get (everything from Tier 1, PLUS):

This tier is for people who understand the *method* behind the brand. Who see the genius in the strategy. Who want to support something bigger than just getting off.

If you're here for depth, intelligence, and intentionality... welcome to Command.

**Tier Name:** Intensity

**Tier Tagline:** "The initiated know."

**Description:**

```
🕊️ TIER 3: INTENSITY

You see it, don't you?

The mission behind the brand. The philosophy behind the pleasure. The *why* underneath all of this.

This tier is not for everyone. It's for the people who understand that this work goes deeper than sensuality. That liberation starts in the body. That pleasure is resistance.

What you get (everything from Tiers 1 & 2, PLUS):
— 6-8 guided audio experiences per month (30-45 min, full immersive journeys)
— Custom audio requests (1 per month, your fantasy, my execution)
— Priority DM access (actual conversations, when it matters)
— Exclusive Tier 3-only content (the most intimate, the most intentional)
— Behind-the-scenes access to the *real* work (the mission, the method, the doctrine)
— Monthly 1:1 voice note exchange (yes, really)

This is the inner circle.

This is where the transactional ends and the transformational begins.

If you're here because you see what most people miss...
If you understand that this is about more than what it looks like...
If you're ready to step into something that actually *matters*...

Welcome home.

— Xiara 🕊️

## WELCOME SEQUENCE (Automated Messages)

**Day 1 (Immediately After Subscribe):**

Tier 1:
```
Hey. Xiara here.

You're in. Welcome.

Here's what you need to know:
— New content drops every Monday (galleries) and Thursday (audio).
— I don't respond to DMs at this tier. Don't take it personally.
— If you want more than this, you know where the upgrade button is.

Start with the audio titled "Sacred Touch." It's my favorite.

Enjoy.

— Xiara 🎀
```

Tier 2:
```
Hey. You made it to Command.

I'm genuinely glad you're here. This tier is different—you'll see.

Here's the deal:
— Content drops Monday/Thursday, but you get it 24 hours early.
— I actually read and respond to DMs here. But don't waste my time with low-effort messages.
— You get voting power on upcoming themes. I'll post polls—use them.

Start with the Tier 2-exclusive audio "Reclaim." It's intense.

Welcome to the real work.

— Xiara 🔥
```

Tier 3:
```
You're here.

I knew you would be.

There's a reason this tier exists, and it's not just for more explicit content. You already know that.

This is where the mission lives. Where the transformation happens. Where we do the real work.

I'll be in your DMs this week with something personal. In the meantime, explore the Tier 3-exclusive essays—they'll give you context for everything else.

And thank you. Seriously. For seeing what most people miss.

Welcome home.

— Xiara 🕊️
```

**Day 3 (Check-In Message):**

Tier 1:
```
Just checking in. Have you listened to any of the audios yet?

If you haven't... what are you waiting for? That's literally why you're here.

If you have... let me know which one was your favorite. I'm curious.

— Xiara
```

Tier 2:
```
Hey. Three days in.

What's resonating with you so far? The galleries? The audio? The method?

I'm genuinely curious. Most people just consume and ghost—I'm hoping you're different.

Drop me a message. Let's talk.

— Xiara
```

Tier 3:
```
It's been three days. I want to hear from you.

Not a "this is hot" message. I want to know what's *landing* for you. What's shifting. What questions are coming up.

This tier is about transformation, not consumption. So let's start the real conversation.

I'm listening.

— Xiara
```

**Day 7 (End of Week 1):**

Tier 1:
```
End of your first week. How's it been?

If you're thinking about upgrading, now's the time. Tier 2 gets you so much more than this.

If you're staying here, that's cool too. Just know what you're missing.

New content drops Monday.

— Xiara
```

Tier 2:
```
One week down.

You've seen the content. You've heard the voice. You've started to understand the method.

Question: What would it take for you to step into Tier 3?

Not a sales pitch—genuinely asking. What's the barrier?

Let me know.

— Xiara
```

Tier 3:
```
One week in Intensity.

How are you feeling? What's shifted?

I promised you transformation, not just transaction. So I need to know—is this landing the way I intended?

Real talk. No performance.

— Xiara
```
