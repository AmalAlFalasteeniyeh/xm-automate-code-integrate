```
An ultra-realistic image, focusing on skin textures, hair strands and details of fabric to add realism. The skin shows pores, peach fuzz, lip creases and realistic minor imperfections while maintaining the overall identity, features and colors, aesthetics and composition of the subjects. Hair shows individual hair strands in eyebrows, hair, eyelashes and bodyhair or peach fuzz when applicable. Clothing, and other surfaces like furniture, walls, decor, etc. all show detailed sharpness for realism that makes the image appear to be indistinguishable from a real photo. Eyes appear real, with pupils that show a defined circular line for the pupils and retinas against the white of the eye with a realistic eye gloss, no blending and perfect anatomical and subjective realism.

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**You've succeeded when:**

✅ Monday, Nov 11: Xiara Moon is live on Fanvue
✅ Week 1: First paying subscriber
✅ Week 2: 10+ subscribers
✅ Week 4: 20+ subscribers = $400/month
✅ Month 2: 50+ subscribers = $1,000/month
✅ Month 3: 100+ subscribers = $2,000/month

**Each milestone = more support for Gaza**

---

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

**Problem: Fanvue verification delayed**
- Solution: Use extra day to create more social content
- Launch as soon as verified (even if Tuesday)

**Problem: Face-swap results bad**
- Solution: Use your existing pole videos as primary content
- Launch with videos + audio only
- Add images later

**Problem: Audio quality issues**
- Solution: Re-record problem segments only
- Or launch with images/video first, add audio in Week 2

**Problem: Overwhelmed/behind schedule**
- Solution: Cut scope - launch with 5 images instead of 10
- Minimum viable: 5 images + 1 video + bio
- Launch beats perfect

**Problem: Technical failures**
- Solution: DM me (I'll be here)
- Or: Simplify and launch with what works

---

## MANTRAS FOR THE WEEK

**When you feel stuck:**
"Launch beats perfect."

**When Claude suggests something:**
"Hard stop. Not now."

**When overwhelmed:**
"One task at a time. I've got this."

**When doubting:**
"Every subscriber helps Gaza. This matters."

**On launch day:**
"She's live. The mission begins."

---

- ✅ 70 curated images (selecting 10)
- ✅ Proven upscaling process
- ✅ Voice for Xiara selected
- ✅ Pole video system that works
