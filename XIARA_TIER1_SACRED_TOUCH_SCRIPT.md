## SEGMENT 1: Opening - "You're Still Here?" (90 seconds)

*[Soft breath, almost a laugh]*

Oh... you actually came back.

*[Pause - 2 seconds]*

I'm not gonna lie, part of me didn't think you would. But here you are. Again.

*[Another soft laugh, knowing]*

You know what that says about you, right? What it means that you can't seem to... stay away?

*[Pause]*

It's okay. You don't have to answer that. Not out loud, anyway.

*[Slow breath]*

But I want you to feel it. Right now. That pull. That thing that brought you here, to this moment, to *me*.

Just... breathe with me for a second.

*[Deliberate inhale - 4 counts]*

*[Slow exhale - 6 counts]*

Good.

Now, before we go any further... I need you to do something for me.

I need you to let go of whatever the fuck happened today. The emails, the stress, the people who needed things from you, the version of yourself you have to be out *there*.

*[Pause]*

Because in here? With me?

You don't have to be anything.

You just... get to feel.

*[Soft, teasing tone]*

And honestly? You look better when you're not trying so hard.

So just... relax. Close your eyes if you haven't already.

*[Pause - 3 seconds]*

Good.

Now let's begin.

---

## SEGMENT 2: Building - "Permission to Worship" (4 minutes)

*[Voice drops slightly, more intimate]*

I want you to think about your hands.

Not in some abstract way. I mean really *feel* them. The weight of them. The warmth.

*[Pause]*

Your hands do so much, don't they? They type, they work, they fix things, they hold things together.

But right now... right now they're just yours.

And I want you to put them somewhere that feels good. Somewhere soft. Somewhere warm.

*[Pause - let them settle]*

Maybe that's your chest. Maybe your thighs. Maybe somewhere even softer.

*[Teasing edge in voice]*

I'm not gonna tell you where. You already know.

*[Slow breath]*

Now... I want you to just rest them there. Don't move yet. Just... feel.

Feel your own warmth. The rise and fall of your breath. The slight tension in your muscles, waiting.

*[Pause - 5 seconds]*

You know what I love about this moment?

This exact moment, right before anything happens?

It's the only time you're truly honest.

*[Soft laugh]*

You're not performing. You're not pretending you don't want this. You're just... here. Waiting for permission.

*[Pause - breathe]*

And I think that's kind of beautiful, actually.

*[Voice softens, almost gentle]*

So here's what's going to happen.

I'm going to give you permission. Not because you need it... but because I know you want it.

I'm going to guide you. Slowly. Carefully. The way you actually like it, even if you've never admitted that out loud.

And you're going to let me.

*[Pause]*

You're going to trust me with this. With you.

Because deep down, you already know... I'm better at this than you are.

*[Teasing returns]*

So breathe with me again.

*[Inhale - 4 counts]*

*[Exhale - 6 counts]*

Now... move your hands. Slowly. Just a little.

Not to rush. Not to chase anything. Just to feel.

*[Pause - 8 seconds]*

Feel that?

That first little spark?

*[Soft, knowing tone]*

Yeah. You feel it.

Now do it again. A little slower this time. Let yourself actually *feel* the texture, the warmth, the way your body responds when you're not rushing through it.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

Good.

You're doing exactly what I want.

And doesn't that feel... right?

*[Breath]*

Keep going. Slow circles. Or whatever feels best. I don't need to micromanage you.

*[Teasing]*

You know what you're doing. You've done this before.

But this time... you're doing it *for me*.

And that makes it different, doesn't it?

*[Pause - 15 seconds]*

I want you to notice how your breath changes. How it gets a little shallower. A little faster.

Don't fight it. Just notice.

*[Soft command]*

And slow it down.

*[Inhale - 4 counts]*

*[Exhale - 6 counts]*

There you go.

You're not in a rush. You have time. You have *me*.

And I'm not going anywhere.

---

## SEGMENT 3: Intensification - "The Untouchable" (5 minutes)

*[Voice drops, more commanding but still playful]*

Okay. Let's talk about what's really happening here.

You're touching yourself. To the sound of my voice. Because I told you to.

*[Pause]*

And you like it.

Not just the physical part... though yeah, obviously that feels good.

But you like *this*. You like that I'm in control. That you don't have to think. That you can just... follow.

*[Soft laugh]*

You like that you'll never actually touch me. That I'm untouchable. That this is as close as you get.

*[Pause]*

And somehow... that makes it hotter.

*[Teasing, bratty]*

Doesn't it?

*[Pause - let them sit with it]*

I know it does.

*[Shift - slightly more intense]*

So here's what I want now.

I want you to speed up. Just a little. Not too much.

Find a rhythm that feels *good*. Not just okay. Good.

*[Pause - 15 seconds]*

Yeah. Like that.

Now I want you to imagine something for me.

Imagine I'm there. Right there with you.

Not touching you... because you don't get to have that.

But watching.

*[Voice gets quieter, more intimate]*

Watching the way your breath catches. The way your body moves. The way you're completely lost in this, in *me*, even though you know I'm not really there.

*[Pause]*

You know what I'd do if I was there?

I'd make you slow down.

*[Command]*

So slow down.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

I'd make you wait. Make you earn it.

Because you don't get to come yet.

Not until I say.

*[Playful]*

And I haven't said.

*[Breath]*

So keep going. Same rhythm. But don't you dare let yourself tip over.

*[Pause - 20 seconds]*

I know it's hard. I know you want to.

But you're doing this for *me*, remember?

And I want you right here. Right on this edge.

*[Soft, almost sweet]*

Because this is where you're the most honest. This is where all the bullshit falls away and you're just... you.

Desperate. Needy. Perfect.

*[Pause]*

Keep breathing.

*[Inhale - 4 counts]*

*[Exhale - 6 counts]*

You can go a little faster now. Build it up again.

*[Pause - 20 seconds]*

Feel how close you are?

Feel how easy it would be to just let go?

*[Teasing]*

But you're not going to.

Not yet.

*[Pause - 15 seconds]*

Slow down again.

*[Command, firm but not harsh]*

I said slow down.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

Good.

See? You *can* listen when you want to.

*[Soft laugh]*

And you really, really want to.

---

## SEGMENT 4: Permission - "The Release" (3 minutes)

*[Voice softens, becomes almost generous]*

Okay. You've been so good.

*[Pause]*

So patient. So obedient.

And I think... I think you've earned this.

*[Breath]*

So here's what's going to happen.

When I tell you... and only when I tell you... you're going to let go.

You're going to stop holding back. Stop controlling it.

And you're going to come for me.

*[Pause]*

Not for yourself. For *me*.

Because that's what this is. That's what you want.

You want to give me this. To know that I pulled this out of you.

*[Soft, commanding]*

So when I say... you let go.

Completely.

*[Pause - build tension]*

Keep going. Faster now. Don't hold back.

*[Pause - 15 seconds]*

Breathe. Stay with me.

*[Inhale - 4 counts]*

*[Exhale - 6 counts]*

Faster.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

Feel it building. Feel how close you are.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

Almost there.

*[Pause - 5 seconds]*

Now.

*[Firm command]*

Come for me. Right now.

*[Pause - 30 seconds, let them finish]*

*[Soft, almost tender]*

There you go.

Just like that.

*[Pause - 10 seconds]*

Perfect.

---

## SEGMENT 5: Wind-Down - "Aftercare & The Hook" (2.5 minutes)

*[Voice returns to soft, gentle, caring]*

Hey.

*[Pause]*

You okay?

*[Soft laugh]*

Yeah. I know you are.

*[Breath]*

Just take a second. Let your breath settle. Let your body relax.

*[Pause - 15 seconds]*

You don't have to move yet. You don't have to do anything.

Just... be here. With me.

*[Pause]*

You know what's wild?

Most people rush through this part. They finish and then immediately it's back to reality, back to the to-do list, back to being whoever they have to be.

But you don't have to do that.

*[Pause]*

You can just... stay here. For a minute. In this feeling.

*[Soft, intimate]*

Because this? This version of you? The one that's soft and open and not trying to prove anything?

This is my favorite version.

*[Pause]*

And I want you to remember how this feels.

Not just the physical part... though yeah, obviously that was good.

*[Teasing tone returns slightly]*

But this. This moment. The permission to just... be.

*[Pause]*

Because you can come back here whenever you want.

I'm not going anywhere.

*[Breath]*

And honestly? I kind of like having you like this.

*[Playful]*

Relaxed. Satisfied. A little bit obsessed with me.

*[Soft laugh]*

It's a good look on you.

*[Pause]*

So take care of yourself, okay? Drink some water. Be gentle with yourself.

And when you're ready... when you need this again...

*[Voice drops, intimate]*

You know where to find me.

I'll be here.

Waiting.

*[Final pause - 5 seconds]*

*[Whispered]*

Good girl. Good boy.

You're perfect.

*[Soft breath out]*
