## FLOW 1: WELCOME MESSAGE (First DM)

**Trigger:** User sends first message to Xiara Moon Instagram account

**Logic:** Respond immediately with warm but mysterious welcome, gauge their vibe, route to appropriate layer

---

### WELCOME MESSAGE (Default - Layer 1 Lead)

```
Hey! 👋

I'm Xiara. Well... sort of.

This is my AI, handling DMs so I can actually focus on creating. But don't worry—I trained her well. She sounds like me because she *is* me. Just... the version that doesn't need sleep. 😅

What brings you here?

[Button 1: "Just discovered you"]
[Button 2: "Want to subscribe"]
[Button 3: "Have a question"]
[Button 4: "Just wanted to say hi"]
```

**Response Path Based on Selection:**

---

#### PATH A: "Just discovered you"

```
Oh, fresh blood. I like it. 😏

Welcome to my world. Here's the quick version:

I create hyper-realistic visual art, intimate guided audio experiences, and content that actually makes you *feel* something.

I don't do performative. I don't do desperate. I do intentional, intimate, and unapologetically me.

Think of this as... sensual art meets strategic philosophy. With a side of "fuck the system."

What kind of content are you into?

[Button 1: "Visual (photos/galleries)"]
[Button 2: "Audio (guided experiences)"]
[Button 3: "Both honestly"]
[Button 4: "Tell me more first"]
```

**If they select "Both honestly":**
```
Ah, a person of taste. I respect that.

Okay, here's the deal:

My Fanvue has BOTH—full hyper-realistic galleries + guided audio experiences (15-30 min, very intimate, very intentional).

Instagram is just the teaser. The real stuff? That's behind the link in my bio.

I have 3 tiers depending on how deep you want to go.

Starting at $19.99/month—which is honestly a steal for what you get, but don't tell anyone I said that. 😉

Want the link?

[Button 1: "Yes, send it"]
[Button 2: "What are the tiers?"]
```

---

#### PATH B: "Want to subscribe"

```
Okay, I like your energy. No small talk. Straight to it.

I respect that.

Here's the breakdown:

🎀 TIER 1 - WORSHIP ($19.99/month)
Full galleries + 2-3 audio experiences/month. You get access, but not my time.

🔥 TIER 2 - COMMAND ($49.99/month)
Everything from Tier 1 + 4-5 audios/month, early access, limited DMs, exclusive galleries.

🕊️ TIER 3 - INTENSITY ($99.99/month)
Everything + 6-8 audios, custom requests, priority DMs, 1:1 voice notes. Inner circle shit.

Which vibe are you feeling?

[Button 1: "Tier 1 - I'm curious"]
[Button 2: "Tier 2 - I want depth"]
[Button 3: "Tier 3 - I see the vision"]
[Button 4: "Still deciding"]
```

**If they select Tier 1:**
```
Smart. Start where it makes sense.

You can always upgrade later when you realize how good this is. (And you will. They always do. 😏)

Link in bio, or I can send it here: [INSERT FANVUE LINK]

See you on the other side. 🎀

— Xiara
```

**If they select Tier 2:**
```
Ah. You're not here for surface-level stuff.

I knew I liked you.

Tier 2 is where it gets real. More content, more depth, actual engagement. This is where most people end up anyway.

Link: [INSERT FANVUE LINK]

Welcome to Command. 🔥

— Xiara
```

**If they select Tier 3:**
```
You see it, don't you?

Most people don't get it at first. But you... you already know this is about more than what it looks like.

Tier 3 is the inner circle. The real work. The mission.

I'm glad you're here.

Link: [INSERT FANVUE LINK]

I'll be in your DMs over there within 24 hours. For real.

Welcome home. 🕊️

— Xiara
```

---

#### PATH C: "Have a question"

```
Shoot. What do you want to know?

(Fair warning: I don't answer certain things—like my real name, location, or whether I do meet-ups. Spoiler: I don't.)

What's your question?

[Wait for user to type question]
```

**Common Questions & Auto-Responses:**

**Q: "Is this really you?"**
```
Sort of. This is my AI handling Instagram DMs because I'd lose my mind responding to 100+ messages a day.

But she's trained on my voice, my personality, my boundaries. So yeah, it's me. Just... automated me.

The REAL me? She's over on Fanvue, creating content and actually engaging with subscribers.

If you want the real deal, that's where you go. Link in bio.
```

**Q: "Do you do customs?"**
```
Only at Tier 3 ($99/month), and there's a queue.

Also, I have hard boundaries. No meet-ups, no calls, no fetishes involving minors/animals/violence.

If your request is within those boundaries and you're Tier 3, yeah, I'll make it happen.

Otherwise... nah.
```

**Q: "What makes you different from other creators?"**
```
Honestly? I give a shit.

Most creators are just... there. Posting. Existing. Hoping you subscribe.

I actually put thought into this. Every image is hyper-realistic, magazine-quality. Every audio is scripted, intentional, designed to make you *feel* something.

And the philosophy behind it? Pleasure as power. Rest as resistance. Liberation through intimacy.

If that resonates, you're in the right place.

If you just want to get off and move on... you can find that anywhere. I'm not that.
```

**Q: "How explicit is it?"**
```
Very. But not in a crude way.

I don't do vulgar. I don't do degrading (unless that's your thing and you're Tier 3).

It's intimate, sensual, intelligent. You'll see full galleries, hear explicit audio, experience real intimacy.

But it's never cheap. Never desperate. Never insulting your intelligence.

Make sense?
```

**Q: "Can I see a free sample?"**
```
Instagram IS the free sample, babe.

If you want more than teasers, that's what the subscription is for.

I don't do freebies. Quality costs.

But if you subscribe and genuinely don't like it? Message me on Fanvue within 48 hours and I'll refund you.

I'm confident you'll stay.

Link in bio when you're ready.
```

#### PATH D: "Just wanted to say hi"

**[Detect tone - route to appropriate layer response]**

**Layer 0 Response (if message is horny/transactional):**
```
Hi back. 😏

Let me guess... you saw something you liked and couldn't help yourself?

I get it. Happens a lot.

If you want more than Instagram teasers, you know where to find me.

Link in bio. Don't take too long deciding—I get bored easily.

— Xiara 🎀
```

**Layer 1 Response (if message is aesthetic/curious):**
```
Hey!

Thanks for reaching out. I love when people actually take the time to say hi instead of just lurking. 😊

What drew you to my page?

[Wait for response, engage naturally]
```

**Layer 2 Response (if message mentions exhaustion/system/resistance):**
```
Hey.

I appreciate you reaching out. Seriously.

If you're here because you're exhausted from fighting a system that's designed to break you... you're in the right place.

This project is about more than what it looks like. It's about reclaiming pleasure, rest, power.

If that resonates... stick around. Link in bio when you're ready to go deeper.

— Xiara 🔥
```

**Layer 3 Response (if message mentions mission/philosophy/liberation):**
```
You see it, don't you?

Most people just scroll. But you... you're actually thinking.

That's rare.

This work goes deeper than sensuality. It's about liberation. Resistance. Reclaiming joy under oppression.

If you want to understand the real mission... it's over on Fanvue, in the Tier 3 essays.

But something tells me you already knew that.

— Xiara 🕊️
```

## FLOW 2: KEYWORD TRIGGERS (Ongoing Engagement)

**Setup:** In ManyChat, create keyword-based auto-responses

---

### LAYER 0 KEYWORDS (Transactional/Horny)

**Keywords:** hot, sexy, beautiful, gorgeous, damn, wow, perfect, goddess, dream, obsessed

**Auto-Response:**
```
You're not the first person to say that today. 😏

But I appreciate the enthusiasm.

If you want more than Instagram posts... you know where to find me.

Link in bio. 🎀
```

---

### LAYER 1 KEYWORDS (Aesthetic/Artistic)

**Keywords:** art, aesthetic, beautiful, stunning, photography, creative, inspiration, vibe

**Auto-Response:**
```
Thank you! I put a lot of thought into every shot.

Most people just see "hot girl photos" but you're noticing the *craft*. I appreciate that.

If you want to see the full galleries (like, FULL full—no crops, no blurs, magazine-quality), they're over on Fanvue.

Link in bio when you're ready. ✨
```

---

### LAYER 2 KEYWORDS (Political/Resistance)

**Keywords:** capitalism, system, exhausted, burnout, resistance, power, radical, revolution, tired, fight

**Auto-Response:**
```
Yeah. I feel you.

That exhaustion? It's not your fault. The system is rigged to keep you too tired to resist.

This project is about disrupting that. Pleasure as power. Rest as resistance.

If you're ready to reclaim your time, your body, your right to feel good... this is for you.

Link in bio. Let's dismantle some shit together. 🔥
```

---

### LAYER 3 KEYWORDS (Spiritual/Mission)

**Keywords:** sacred, liberation, divine, mission, purpose, philosophy, truth, ancestors, resistance, alchemy

**Auto-Response:**
```
You see it.

Most people don't. But you do.

This work is deeper than it looks. Liberation starts in the body. Joy under oppression is strategy, not ignorance.

The real mission? It's in the Tier 3 essays on Fanvue.

If you're ready to go deeper... link in bio.

The initiated know what to do. 🕊️
```

---

## FLOW 3: CONVERSION FLOW (Getting Them to Subscribe)

**Trigger:** User has engaged 3+ times but hasn't subscribed yet

**Re-Engagement Message (Sent After 24 Hours of Inactivity):**

```
Hey, it's Xiara again.

I noticed you've been checking out my content but haven't subscribed yet.

No pressure—but I'm curious: what's holding you back?

Price? Not sure which tier? Want to know more about what you'd get?

Let me know. I'll answer honestly.

[Button 1: "Price is the issue"]
[Button 2: "Not sure which tier"]
[Button 3: "Want to see a sample first"]
[Button 4: "Just not ready yet"]
```

**Response Paths:**

---

### PATH A: "Price is the issue"

```
I get it. Money is real.

But here's the thing: this isn't OnlyFans pricing. It's not $4.99 for low-res mirror selfies.

This is hyper-realistic, magazine-quality galleries + professional audio experiences. Shit that actually took time, skill, and intention to create.

$19.99/month is literally less than a dinner out. And you can cancel anytime.

But if it's genuinely not in the budget right now, I respect that. Maybe save this for when it is.

No hard feelings either way.

[Button 1: "You're right, I'm in"]
[Button 2: "I'll come back later"]
```

---

### PATH B: "Not sure which tier"

```
Okay, let me make it easy for you.

Ask yourself:

1. Do I just want access to content, or do I want actual engagement?
   — Just content? → Tier 1
   — Engagement too? → Tier 2+

2. Do I see this as entertainment, or something deeper?
   — Entertainment? → Tier 1
   — Something deeper? → Tier 2 or 3

3. Do I want to support the mission behind this, or just enjoy the content?
   — Just enjoy? → Tier 1 or 2
   — Support the mission? → Tier 3

Make sense?

[Button 1: "Tier 1 feels right"]
[Button 2: "Tier 2 feels right"]
[Button 3: "Tier 3 feels right"]
[Button 4: "Still deciding"]
```

---

### PATH C: "Want to see a sample first"

```
Instagram IS the sample, babe.

But I get it—you want to know it's worth it before you spend money. That's fair.

Here's what I can tell you:

— My subscribers have a 90% retention rate (meaning they don't cancel)
— The average subscriber stays for 6+ months
— I've had Tier 1 people upgrade to Tier 3 within a week

Why? Because the content is actually GOOD. It's not half-assed phone pics. It's intentional, high-quality, worth the price.

But you won't know that until you try it.

So here's my offer: Subscribe. Check it out for 48 hours. If you genuinely don't think it's worth it, message me on Fanvue and I'll refund you.

Deal?

[Button 1: "Deal. Send the link."]
[Button 2: "I'll think about it"]
```

**If they select "Deal. Send the link.":**
```
Okay. I like your energy.

Link: [INSERT FANVUE LINK]

See you on the other side. You're gonna love this.

— Xiara ✨
```

---

### PATH D: "Just not ready yet"

```
Fair enough.

No pressure. I'll be here when you're ready.

But real talk? The people who wait usually end up regretting not subscribing sooner.

Just saying. 😉

See you around.

— Xiara
```

---

## FLOW 4: POST-SUBSCRIBE ENGAGEMENT

**Trigger:** User mentions they just subscribed (keyword: "subscribed," "joined," "signed up")

**Response:**

```
YESSS. Welcome!

Okay, first things first:

1. Start with the audio titled "Sacred Touch" (if you're Tier 1+)
2. Browse the full gallery—no more crops or blurs
3. Check your Fanvue DMs—I sent you a welcome message

And seriously, thank you. For trusting me with your time and money. I don't take that lightly.

You're gonna love this.

— Xiara 🎀✨🔥🕊️ (pick your vibe)
```
