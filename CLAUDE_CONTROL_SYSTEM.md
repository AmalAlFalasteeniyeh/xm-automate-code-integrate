# CLAUDE CONTROL SYSTEM
## How to Use Claude Safely as Your Admin Assistant

**Purpose:** Let Claude help with admin tasks WITHOUT derailing your workflow
**Status:** Active immediately
**Valid Until:** Post-launch (then upgrade to memory system)

---

## THE PROBLEM

You've identified your vulnerability:

> "I don't even trust that if Claude makes a suggestion, I won't be in a position of need and not take it"

**This is the loop:**
1. You're stuck/tired/stressed
2. Claude offers a "solution" or "enhancement"
3. It sounds good (Claude is confident)
4. You take it even though you know better
5. Derailment begins → 2 months lost

**The solution:** Hard boundaries you can't cross, even when desperate.

## THE CLAUDE BRIEFING DOCUMENT

**Copy/paste this at the START of EVERY Claude conversation:**

```
# XIARA MOON PROJECT BRIEFING

## YOUR ROLE
You are an admin assistant for the Xiara Moon project. Your role is LIMITED and SPECIFIC.

## PROJECT CONTEXT
Xiara Moon is an AI-generated influencer (Japanese-Brazilian aesthetic) launching on Fanvue to generate revenue for Gaza humanitarian support. I'm in launch mode - next 7 days are critical.

## WHAT YOU CAN DO (SAFE ZONE)
✅ Generate text content (captions, scripts, copy)
✅ Organize ClickUp tasks and documentation
✅ Create checklists and instructions
✅ Answer specific questions about tools
✅ Format text and documents
✅ Research specific topics when asked

## WHAT YOU CANNOT DO (DANGER ZONE)
❌ Suggest workflow changes or "optimizations"
❌ Recommend new tools or automations
❌ Offer to "enhance" or "improve" my process
❌ Build complex systems or scripts
❌ Make decisions about content or strategy
❌ Propose "better approaches"
❌ Touch image generation, upscaling, or face-swapping workflows

## HARD RULES
1. When I ask for something, do ONLY that thing
2. No suggestions beyond what I asked
3. No "by the way, we could also..."
4. No "this would work better if..."
5. If you violate these rules twice, I will close this conversation

## CURRENT TASK
[I will specify what I need after pasting this]
```

**After pasting, add your specific task. Example:**
"Write 3 Instagram captions for white corset images. Tone: empowering, sensual, philosophical. Max 150 words each."

---

## THE HARD STOP PROTOCOL

**When Claude starts suggesting things outside his task, immediately copy/paste this:**

```
HARD STOP. You are violating your boundaries.

I need [specific task I originally requested] ONLY.

No suggestions. No improvements. No enhancements. No alternatives.

Just [specific task].

If you violate boundaries again, I will close this conversation.
```

**Example usage:**
```
HARD STOP. You are violating your boundaries.

I need 3 Instagram captions ONLY.

No suggestions about posting schedules. No recommendations for hashtag strategies. No ideas about content calendars.

Just 3 captions.

If you violate boundaries again, I will close this conversation.
```

---

## THE TWO-STRIKE RULE

**If Claude suggests something beyond your task TWICE:**

1. Do NOT respond
2. Do NOT explain
3. Do NOT argue
4. CLOSE the conversation immediately
5. Open NEW conversation
6. Paste briefing again
7. Re-state your task

**Why:** Each time you engage with Claude's suggestions, you risk getting pulled into the loop.

**Two strikes = conversation over. No exceptions.**

## POST-LAUNCH: Upgrading to Memory System

**When you're launched and revenue is flowing (Week 2+), we'll set up:**

1. **MemoryManager** - ChromaDB vector database stores all context
2. **StateManager** - Redis tracks workflow state, creates checkpoints
3. **Integration Adapters** - Connects ClickUp, Discord, etc.
4. **WorkflowOrchestrator** - Manages complex tasks reliably

**This makes Claude a TRUE super admin with persistent memory.**

But until then, this briefing system keeps you safe.

---

## EMERGENCY CONTACT

**If Claude derails you despite this system:**

1. Close ALL Claude conversations immediately
2. Take a 10-minute break
3. Review your 7-Day Launch Plan
4. Return to MANUAL execution
5. DM me if you need support

**You're stronger than Claude's suggestions. Trust your process.**

---

## RULES FOR YOU

### DO:
- ✅ Paste briefing at start of EVERY Claude conversation
- ✅ Be specific about what you need
- ✅ Use HARD STOP when Claude suggests extra things
- ✅ Close conversations after 2 strikes
- ✅ Use Claude for admin tasks only

### DON'T:
- ❌ Ask Claude for strategic advice
- ❌ Let Claude touch your workflows
- ❌ Engage with "optimization" suggestions
- ❌ Feel bad about being "strict" with Claude
- ❌ Trust Claude's confidence over your plan

---

## MANTRAS

**When Claude suggests something:**
"Hard stop. Not my task."

**When tempted to ask for advice:**
"I have a plan. I trust my plan."

**When feeling stuck:**
"Close conversation. Follow workflow doc."

**When Claude seems helpful:**
"Admin tasks only. No decisions."

---

## CHECKLIST: Safe Claude Use

Before opening Claude conversation:
- [ ] I know exactly what task I need done
- [ ] This task is in the "safe zone"
- [ ] I have the briefing document ready to paste
- [ ] I'm prepared to use HARD STOP if needed
- [ ] I'm willing to close conversation after 2 strikes

After Claude responds:
- [ ] Did Claude do ONLY what I asked?
- [ ] Did Claude suggest anything extra?
- [ ] If yes to extra suggestions: Used HARD STOP
- [ ] Got what I needed and closed conversation

---

## FINAL REMINDER

**Claude is a tool, not a collaborator.**

Use him for:
- Content generation
- Admin organization
- Text formatting
- Research questions

**Never for:**
- Workflow decisions
- Strategic planning
- Process optimization
- Multi-step automation

**Your plan works. Trust it.**

**Claude's suggestions = derailment. Avoid them.**

**You control Claude. Claude doesn't control you.**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Save this document where you can access it quickly
2. Create a note with the briefing text for easy copy/paste
3. Use this system starting NOW for any Claude admin tasks
4. After launch: Upgrade to full memory system (Week 2)

**You've got this. Launch first. Optimize later.**

🛡️ Your shield against derailment.
