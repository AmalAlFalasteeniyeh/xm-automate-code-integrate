**Purpose:** The psychological monetization engine for Xiara Moon
**Core Principle:** "Almost satisfied" state → Creates desire for MORE → Drives conversions

## 🎯 THE FOUR TEASE FRAMEWORKS

### **1. STRATEGIC STYLING - "SHOW VS HIDE" (15 Techniques)**

#### **Natural Censorship:**
```
Hair covering breasts like natural censorship
Arm placement suggesting nudity while covered
Hand placement suggesting exposure while covering
```
**Psychology:** "Accidental" coverage = Viewer believes reveal is just barely avoided

#### **Environmental Censorship:**
```
Strategic shadow play hiding and revealing
Steam/mist creating mysterious coverage
Furniture blocking key areas artfully
Water/bubbles providing artistic coverage
```
**Psychology:** Environment "protects" modesty = Viewer feels they almost saw something

#### **Fabric/Material Censorship:**
```
Sheet placement barely maintaining modesty
Fabric caught mid-fall frozen moment
```
**Psychology:** Fabric is "about to fail" = Tension of imminent reveal

#### **Lighting/Framing Censorship:**
```
Lighting creating silhouette showing curves only
Backlit transparency showing form through fabric
Partial framing cutting off at perfect moments
```
**Psychology:** Technical "limitations" create mystery = Professional artistic excuse

#### **Body Positioning Censorship:**
```
Leg crossed hiding while revealing thigh
Mirror reflection showing what camera doesn't
```
**Psychology:** Angle "happens to hide" key areas = Viewer wants to see other angle

#### **Post-Activity Scenarios:**

#### **The "Perfect Accident":**
```

Hair placement perfect accident
Shadow falling exactly right
Leg angle creating visual barrier
Hand blocking the reveal
```
**Psychology:** "Not intentional" = Authentic vulnerability appeal
