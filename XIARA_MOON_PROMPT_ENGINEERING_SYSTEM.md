```

### Additional Enhancement Layer (Optional)
For hyper-realistic upscaling, add after main prompt generation:
```
Ultra-realistic skin texture with visible pores, individual hair strands with natural shine and movement, fabric weave details at micro level, precise anatomical accuracy, photorealistic lighting physics
```

## THE 7 PILLARS OF SUCCESS {#seven-pillars}

### What Makes These Prompts Generate Perfect Results

#### 1. STRATEGIC COVERAGE ARCHITECTURE
Don't say "sexy" - engineer exactly HOW the tease happens:
- "hand strategically placed across bust holding robe closed"
- "Hair cascading over one breast creating natural censorship"
- "shadows creating strategic coverage while showing silhouette"
- "barely tied at waist with silk ribbon threatening to come undone"

**Key:** AI understands mechanical coverage better than abstract concepts.

#### 2. FABRIC PHYSICS SPECIFICITY
Treat fabric like a character with behavior using active verbs:
- "draping off body"
- "clinging to every curve"
- "gaping open revealing sides"
- "threatening to slip"
- "riding up"

**Key:** Describe what fabric DOES, not just what it IS.

#### 3. LIGHTING AS FUNCTIONAL ELEMENT
Lighting does the work of censoring and revealing:
- "strategic lighting creates shadows over chest"
- "chiaroscuro effect showing goosebumps"
- "Backlit silhouette showing curves through sheer fabric"
- "window frame shadows on the wall and body"

**Key:** Light is a tool for coverage, not just atmosphere.

#### 4. POSE MECHANICS (Not "Vibes")
Specific, replicable body positioning:
- "Straddling backwards on chair with arms crossed over chair back"
- "seated with back arched on velvet chaise, one leg on each side"
- "Leaning back against wall with one arm raised overhead stretching"

**Key:** AI can't interpret "sexy pose" but CAN interpret mechanical instructions.

#### 5. THE PARADOX PRINCIPLE
Pair opposites to create visual tension:
- "Rebel energy softened by vulnerable morning aesthetic"
- "Edgy rebel confidence meets soft vulnerable beauty"
- "Raw sensual confidence meets soft feminine vulnerability"
- "Haute couture meets boudoir"

**Key:** Prevents AI from defaulting to generic "sexy woman" tropes.

#### 6. TEXTURAL CONTRAST STACKING
Layer textures deliberately:
- Silk + lace + leather
- Sheer + solid + mesh
- Soft fabric + hard surfaces (concrete, leather chair)
- Delicate + raw + industrial

**Key:** Multiple texture layers = visual complexity = doesn't look AI-generic.

#### 7. THE "NOT" STATEMENTS
Explicitly tell AI what to avoid:
- "Not basic, not cliche"
- "Boudoir elegance without cliche"
- "Dynamic natural pose"
- "Tastefully suggestive"

**Key:** Negative commands help AI avoid default patterns.
