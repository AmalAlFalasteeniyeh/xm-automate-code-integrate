- Multi-platform distribution (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Reddit)

**Mission:** Replace $700K lost from Zeffy closure via FanVue revenue.

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

1. **Seed 1605471498** = Xiara's visual DNA (Leonardo Seedream 4.0)
2. **Pipeline tested**: Prompt Studio → Leonardo → Face-swap → NIM Video
3. **Content exists**:
   - Audio scripts (Tier 1, 2, 3) ✅
   - Brand strategy ✅
   - Instagram launch posts ✅
   - ManyChat flows ✅
   - FanVue setup guide ✅

**PROBLEM:** Everything is MANUAL. Can't scale.

   - Memory per subscriber
   - **STATUS:** ❌ HIGH VALUE

9. **User profiling & layer detection**
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Layer classification (0/1/2/3)
   - Content personalization
   - **STATUS:** ❌ NEEDED

### WEEK 4: Distribution
10. **Platform upload automation**
    - FANVUE, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter
    - Scheduled posting
    - Caption rotation
    - **STATUS:** 🟡 NEEDS SETUP

11. **Analytics dashboard**
    - Revenue tracking
    - Engagement metrics
    - Performance monitoring
    - **STATUS:** 🟡 NEEDED

12. **Video workflows**
    - Path A: Hybrid (image sequences + motion graphics)
    - Path B: Stock video + face-swap (backup)
    - Path C: AI video generation (experimental)
    - **STATUS:** 🟡 TEST & IMPLEMENT

## ⚠️ 11 POTENTIAL FLAWS IDENTIFIED (With Fixes)

The manual brilliantly identifies every potential failure point:

1. **Prompt randomness** → Vibe check validation
2. **Face-swap dependency** → Build 3 backup methods
3. **AI quality scoring** → Human-in-loop training
4. **Video uncanny valley** → Multi-path strategy with testing
5. **AI response tone mistakes** → Safety measures + review
6. **Duplicate AI girlfriend messages** → Variation engine
7. **User layer misclassification** → Self-correction + manual override
8. **Aggressive upsells** → Smart frequency limits
9. **AI script voice mismatch** → Human-AI collaboration phases
10. **Robotic AI voice** → Quality testing + hybrid approach
11. **Algorithm shadowban** → Platform-specific optimization

**Each flaw has a complete solution documented.**

## 📅 THE TIMELINE

```
WEEK 1 (Days 1-7):   Foundation (Discord bot, quality system)
WEEK 2 (Days 8-14):  Content (Script agent, voice pipeline, audio)
WEEK 3 (Days 15-21): Engagement (Response agent, AI GF, profiling)
WEEK 4 (Days 22-28): Distribution (Platform automation, analytics, video)
DAY 29-30:           Launch prep (test everything, pre-generate content)
DAY 30:              🚀 LAUNCH
```

**After launch:** $50K+ in first 30 days for Palestine

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW

### Immediate Decisions Needed:

1. **Branch Strategy:**
   - Current branch: CLAUDE.md + OAuth hub
   - Auth-login branch: All Xiara content + automation codebase
   - **QUESTION:** Merge or work from auth-login?

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - User has permissions issues in new directory
   - Need to understand what's not working
   - **QUESTION:** What specifically is failing?

3. **Build Priority:**
   - The manual says "Start with Week 1 (Discord bot automation)"
   - **QUESTION:** Should I start building NOW or wait for setup?

4. **Prompt Studio Flaws:**
   - Manual mentions flaws but says "ask user"
   - **QUESTION:** What are the specific flaws?
